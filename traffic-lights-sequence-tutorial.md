# ERPS STEM WEEK :: Traffic Lights - Sequence Tutorial

## Introduction
### Introduction Step @unplugged
Hopefully you've got your lights working! But traffic lights have a particular sequence...
On a piece of paper, can you write down the steps that a traffic light goes through, and
in which order the lights come on? Once you are done, come back and click OK to get to the next step.

### Sequence Step @unplugged
Did you figure out the sequence? There are four 'stages': "Stop", "Get ready", "Go" and "Prepare to stop".
